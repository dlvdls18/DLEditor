# Default modules
When adding builder script to your project, `default` modules will be available.
Take note that default modules are only syntax highlighter and snippets

## Syntax Highlighter

```js
editor.applySyntaxHighlighter("default");
```

This is a small syntax highlighter module, it only colors invisible characters and numbers.
Numbers are colored white and hidden characters (`\0`, `\n`, `\t`, `\s`) are colored dark gray.

## Snippets

```js
editor.applySnippet("default");
```

This is a very small snippets module.
It's just the lorem dummy text.

# Building module tips

## Use `DLEditor.DefinedModules` to define your module

To make the window clean, don't scatter built modules.
Define it in a single object and it is the `DLEditor.DefinedModules`.
This is fully optional but recommended.

```js
// Don't
window.MyDLEditorModuleSyntaxHighlighter = ...

// Do
DLEditor.DefinedModules.MySyntaxHighlighter = ...
```

## `IMPORTANT` Exporting your module
Every constructed modules will not be available when applying it unless you export it.

```js
myModule.exportModule();
```

You can call this when everything is ready.

## Difference between Theme and Syntax Highlighter
Theme is just designing the editor and not the actual editor texts.
While Syntax Highlighter designs editor text.

## Problem with Theme and Syntax Highlighter
When the theme is in light mode, the Syntax Highlighter does not change.
It is recommended to use a module with Theme and Syntax Highlighter so light mode is supported.
Because theme can be light mode while syntax highlighter is not, or the syntax highlighter is light mode but the theme is not making the editor ugly.
